    <h1>TEXT FORMATTING TAGS</h1>
    <p>In 1980, physicist <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b>, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped <strong>ENQUIRE</strong>, a system for
         CERN researchers to <i>use and share documents</i>. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a <cite>memo proposing an Internet-based 
         hypertext system</cite>.Berners-Lee specified <em>HTML</em> and wrote the <mark>browser and server software</mark> in late 1990.
         That year, <del>Berners-Lee and CERN</del> data systems engineer <strike>Robert Cailliau</strike> collaborated on a joint 
         request for <ins>funding</ins>,but the <sub>project</sub> was not formally adopted by <sup>CERN</sup>. In his <small>personal notes 
         </small>of 1990, Berners-Lee listed <big>some of the many areas in which hypertext is used</big>; an <q>encyclopedia</q> is the <center> 
        first entry</center>.</p>
